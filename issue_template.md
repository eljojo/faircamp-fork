# Issue Checklist

1. If one of the following applies, please go right ahead and clear this box to post your issue:

  - Something is broken
  - Some documentation is missing or unclear
  - Some aspect of how this works is way too technical for me
  - There is an accessibility problem
  - There is an issue with installation
  - Something else that's conceptually a bug report

2. If your topic clearly falls within the scope of "feature wishlist":

    First check if the idea falls reasonably close within the principles faircamp
    adheres to (personal, plain, small, simple, light, fast, reduced, elegant,
    stable, low/no-maintenance, free, independent, privacy-respecting,
    standards-conforming, no-nonsense). If it does, take this one moment to
    call up the context in which faircamp is created and maintained right now -
    by a single person, in their free time - and call to mind that there is
    already a long list of issues and improvements in the background being
    worked on, and that, out of necessity, anything new can only get
    immediate attention at the expense of another thing not getting it.
    With that in mind, I invite you to share your thoughts on these channels:

  - Most ideally, as the opportunity arises, in person at a conference or in a live online setting
  - Also preferably, on the fediverse: https://post.lurk.org/@freebliss
  - Alternatively, via email: simon@fdpl.io

3. If you're unsure whether your topic falls within either of the two categories, please also just go ahead and post it, we'll figure it out.
