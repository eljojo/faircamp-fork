[1] On feature requests, suggestions and ideas:

Faircamp currently follows a seasonal development cycle, where one season is
dedicated to the discussion and evaluation of future developments - including
feature requests. The other season - which we are in right now - is
exclusively dedicated to making substantial progress through complete,
undistracted attention on conceptualization, design and development.

In other words: Please make a note of what you just by came to share! Keep it
alive, gladly refine and revisit your thoughts in the meantime, and check
back to share it when Faircamp again enters iits first seasonal cycle and the
feature suggestions thread opens its doors again!
