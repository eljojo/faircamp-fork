# Installation

On debian-based Linux faircamp can already be installed via packages
(amd64). On Arch Linux and Manjaro faircamp is available through the AUR. For
RPM-based distros and FreeBSD, copy/paste build and install instructions are
available. On macOS faircamp can be installed using Homebrew. Windows users
have so far used WSL or docker to run faircamp - there are no known native
build attempts for Windows yet, but there should be no hard blockers for
building faircamp there either, general build instructions for this are
provided.
