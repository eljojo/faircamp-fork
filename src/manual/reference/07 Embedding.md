# Embedding

This allows external sites to embed a widget that presents music from your site.
The embed code can be copied from each release page where embedding is enabled.

Embedding is enabled by default. You can use `disabled` to disable it and
`enabled` to re-enable it for specific albums.

```eno
# embedding

disabled
```
