# Faircamp Manual

The manual is organized into *topics*, *examples* and *reference* pages.

## Topics

For an introduction go through the topics in order. These show how faircamp
works in general and swiftly guide you to your first faircamp site.

## Examples

These each explain a fictional faircamp catalog - how the file layout is
structured, what metadata from audio files it uses, and how the manifests are
placed and used to customize the site for each respective usecase. This
teaches by example, but does not necessarily show *every* feature there is in
faircamp, so also consider going through the reference to get the full
picture.

## Reference

The reference pages explain all available options and metadata that you can
set in your manifests, giving detailed info for each setting.

## Other resources

resources, a feature overview, screenshots, and a list of faircamp sites to
