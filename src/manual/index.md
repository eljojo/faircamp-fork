# The Faircamp Manual

The manual is organized into *topics* and *reference* pages.

To get started, it is recommended to consult the topics, in order. These give
you an overview of how faircamp works in general and quickly lead you to your
first faircamp website.

After you've familiarized yourself with the basics, the reference pages then cover
all available options and metadata that you can set in your manifest(s).
