# Installation

On debian-based Linux faircamp can already be installed via packages
(amd64). On Arch Linux and Manjaro faircamp is available through the AUR. For
RPM-based distros and macOS, copy/paste build and install instructions
are available. On BSD and Windows you are entering uncharted territory, but
in general there should be no hard blockers for running faircamp on these
platforms either, general build instructions for this are provided.
