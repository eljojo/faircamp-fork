# Tags

This is an attempt to document which tags (in terms of low-level technical specification)
faircamp supports/uses for its own fields, which ones it writes, etc. Note that this
documentation might not necessarily be 100% complete or accurate (yet).

## AIFF

Same tags as MP3 and WAV - see ID3.

## ALAC

# Flac

Tag decoding for Flac uses the [metaflac](https://crates.io/crates/metaflac) crate.

Same tags as Ogg Vorbis and Opus - see Ogg Vorbis.

## ID3

Tag decoding for ID3 uses the [id3](https://github.com/polyfloyd/rust-id3) crate.

## Opus

Tag decoding for Opus uses the [opus_headers](https://crates.io/crates/opus_headers) crate.

Same tags as Flac and Ogg Vorbis - see Ogg Vorbis.

## WAV

Known limitiations:
- Album artist tags can not be written to WAV files (at least not by FFmpeg,
  which is used by faircamp to encode audio files), therefore this tag will
  not appear in any WAV files generated by faircamp.
- Tags will only be copied to WAV output files with the `tags: copy` release
  option. (FFmpeg does not support explicitly defining the tags to be written
  to a WAV file, it only allows a full copy to be performed, or at least attempted)
- ID3 in WAV is generally pretty non-standard, so anything relating to tags in WAV
  can be considered unstable and might lead to glitches down to the player level.

Same tags as AIFF and MP3 - see ID3.
